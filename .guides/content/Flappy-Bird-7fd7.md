# Flappy Bird Clone

This clone of Flappy Bird was inspired by this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZg49z76cLw). Click the button below to start the game. You need to click on the game before it will register keyboard input. Press the space bar to flap the bird's wings.

The tab with `game.py` is the class that provides the logic for the game. The file `flappy.py` implements the class to make the actual game.

{try it}(bash .guides/bg.sh python flappy.py 1)
